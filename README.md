# Challenge-Seismic-Detection-Across-the-Solar-System
Planetary seismology missions struggle with the power requirements necessary to send continuous seismic data back to Earth. But only a fraction of this data is scientifically useful! Instead of sending back all the data collected, what if we could program a lander to distinguish signals from noise, and send back only the data we care about?
